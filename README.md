## Lecture Notes

Intro, what is programming

First program, hello world, demo

expressions (arithmetic)

variables (substitution)

import

Function as a blackbox

functions, greeting (print name), math.fabs/sin, degToRad



Fireworks, demo

Blackbox, diagram

Polar




(if there is time)

loops, print numbers from 1 to 10, from 1 to a, factorial (with function)

lists





1. Black box

    Everyday examples: phone, car, ticket machines, math functions

    Example: fireworks program, give it a function that defines the shape
    and that defines the color

2. Functions

    Example: just like math functions, show how to define some different
    shapes

3. Control

    Example: computer makes choices (logic), show how to define color
    function

## Lab Work

Go through one firework example together (simple.py)

Let students create their own firework shapes and colors

main_example.py has a wide variety of shapes and colors
